# Project Idin

## Overview
During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals all around the world are experiencing shortages in equipment 
such as protective gear and respiratory tools. Inventory Distribution Network (IDiN)  was created to 
address this issue through the use of predictive analysis to allow hospitals to preemptively order items 
from suppliers or redistribute their supplies to and from neighbouring hospitals. IDiN is responsible for monitoring 
and analysing trends of a hospitalâ€™s inventory, and then takes action based on its predictions. IDiN could send a message to neighbouring 
hospitals who are overstocked with supplies or preemptively notify suppliers about upcoming shortages. This application encourages collaboration 
between business and communities to overcome this global pandemic.

This application was initially created for the [Call For Code 2020](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode) hackathon.
A working demo of this application can be found [here](https://project-idin.herokuapp.com).
